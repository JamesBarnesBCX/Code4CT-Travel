# Module 3 - Lesson 4

## Task

Working in lesson4.js, Write a JavaScript function called mostPopular which returns the highest value in an array. This will be used to calculate the most popular destinations based on an array called popularity.

Example:

`var array = [2,3,4,5];` with this array

`console.log(mostPopular(array))` should give a result of 5

## Steps

1. In the specified area in lesson4js create a function called mostPopular which accepts an array parameter.
2. Inside your function do the following:

  - Create a variable called most which is set to 0
  - Loop through the array accepted by mostPopular using a for loop
  - For each value in the array check if it is greater than most
  - If so, change most to be equal to that value from the array
  - after the loop is finished return the value of most
  - If everything is working correctly you should see 4 destinations on the homepage which are the most popular destinations

3. Download your previous lesson1.js,lesson2.js and lesson3.js and place them in the js folder, replacing the old ones.

4. Save the whole folder to google drive and tell your tutors/teacher that you have finished so they can come and check how you ahev done.

5. (Code Optional) If you have completed steps 1 and 2 and the 4 most popular destinations are appearing on the homepage then write a function called averagePopularity which also accepts and array, calculates the average of the values in the array. Execute the function at the bottom of your code and pass the popularity array to it. Use console.log to display you result.

6. (Fun Optional) In the lesson2.js that you worked on in the second lesson, in the offersData array each place has a description of "None", search online for better descriptions and replace what is there.

# Notes
